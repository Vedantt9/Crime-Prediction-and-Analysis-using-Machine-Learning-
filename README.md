In my project, I built a model that analyzed major crimes in Toronto, Canada, using data from the official police department. I put four algorithms—Random Forest, Gradient Booster, Decision Stump, and KNN—to the test. After crunching the numbers, Random Forest emerged as the accuracy champ, providing the most reliable results.
